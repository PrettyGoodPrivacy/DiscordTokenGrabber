his token grabber is very simple. there are no downloads requires other than Python. 



After that you need to make a discord Server or if you already have one make a channel only you and people you trust can
access it. 

After that make a webhook to the channel, copy the webhook link then open the python file using notepad and scroll down 
till u see a webhook link (line 89), your gonna replace that link with your own. To test if you have done this right, run the file
and see if ur token pops up in the channel.
